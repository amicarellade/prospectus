\title{Visualizing NFL Draft Data}

\author{Dante Amicarella, Jack Lafond, Mason Perham}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
As of now, there is no formal way of viewing draft data for analysts or NFL fanatics around the world.
\section{Project Description}
This project aims to create functional visualizations for NFL Draft data. 
\section{Project Type}
This project will be a web-application that allows the user to view NFL data in two different tabs. One tab will present data in a coordinated visualization, while the other will be in a scrolley-telling format. 
\section{Audience} 
As the NFL community continually grows, impactful moments like the NFL Draft have not been dissected by visualization's. The outcomes of this project will help create a regulated and functional manner to visualize NFL Draft data.

\section{Major Milestones}

\section{Obstacles}

\subsection{Major obstacles} % (if these fail, the project is over)

\subsection{Minor obstacles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Having no experience with scrolley-telling formats.
\end{itemize}
\section{Resources Needed}
\begin{quote}
We will not need any additional resources for this project.

\section{5 Related Publications}
\begin{quote}
\textit{List 5 major publications that are most relevant to this project, and how they are related (sample citation \cite{wijk2005value}).}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{perin2018state} This publication speaks about the current state of the art sports data visualization. Our project is about NFL draft data.
    \item \cite{krzywinski2012hive} This publication speaks about the use of hive plots in data visualization, and we are using a hive plot as our main visualization.
    \item \cite{janetzko2016enhancing} This publication is about enhancing parallel coordinate plots, specifically, introducing different distribution plots on the  axes to better display the information in the data. We will be using PCP's in our project and we will also need to figure out how to convey information when we have many player data points converging to one area.
    \item \cite{morth2023SCrollyVis}https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9887905 - Scrollytelling - Writing and Design
    \item \cite{morth2023scrollyvis} This article demonstrates the ability of ScrollyVisualizations 
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\section{Define Success}
This project will be publishable if we are able to create all the visualizations necessary to tell the narrative we are trying to make. Although the design and interaction element is a big part of our project. Our visualizations would still be functional without the animations in a scrolley-telling.
